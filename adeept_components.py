# DRIVEMOTOR CLASS DEFINITION
# ======================================================================

class DriveMotor:
    """
    Control a drive motor that's connected to an L298N controller.

    Connect the drive motor to either the "Motor A" or "Motor B" port on
    the Adeept HAT.

    An L298N controller has two sets of H-bridge connections.  Each
    H-bridge has an ENABLE connection, two INPUT connections and two
    OUTPUT connections.  If ENABLE is high then power is sent to the
    OUTPUT connections according to the INPUT signals.  With a DC motor
    connected, the INPUT signals have the following effect:

               |INPUT 2|INPUT 2|
               |is low |is high|
        -------+-------+-------+
        INPUT 1|Fast   |Revese |  "Forward" and "Reverse" are arbitrary
        is low |brake  |       |  directions here
        -------+-------+-------|
        INPUT 1|Forward|Fast   |
        is high|       |brake  |
        -------+-------+-------+

    If ENABLE is low then the motor will receive no power and it will
    free-wheel.

    PWM can be used on the ENABLE connection to control the speed of the
    motor.

    On an Adeept HAT, the ENABLE and INPUT connections are connected to
    GPIO pins and the OUTPUT connections are connected to the "Motor A"
    and "Motor B" ports.

#
# An RGB LED uses three GPIO pins -- one for each of its primary color emiters.  The brightness
# of each emiter is controlled through pulse-width modulation.

# Connect the RGB LED to either the "RGB1" or "RGB2" port on the Adeept Motor HAT.

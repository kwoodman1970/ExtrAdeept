## About This Project

My brother and his family gave me a [Raspberry Pi](https://raspberrypi.com/) and an [Adeept Rasptank](https://www.adeept.com/rasptank_p0121.html) kit.  The software that comes with it makes the machine a high-tech remote-controlled vehicle, but I wanted it to do more than that &ndash; I wanted to unlock its full programmable potential.

This project contains a set of Python classes for controlling components (e.g. motors, lights, and sensors) that are connected to an [Adeept HAT](https://www.adeept.com/search/?Keyword=hat&Price=20-40).

**Note:** The code in this repository is specific to [Adeept HAT's](https://www.adeept.com/search/?Keyword=hat&Price=20-40), though it could be adapted to work with controller HAT's from other manufacturers.
